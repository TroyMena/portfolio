# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Troy Mena, and here you will see all my work; through which I have used the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages!

## Notes

Unfortunately, I was not able to get my flex boxes (including some commented out ones on the CSS code) at the desired positions; hence why this website is incomplete, unfortunately. I plan on scheduling tutoring sessions as soon as possible to make sure I will have a thorough understanding of CSS for the remainder of this course.
